# CS229 Problem Set Python Implementation
This is the python implementation of the problem sets of CS229 in Fall 2016. Official lecture notes, exercises, and solutions can be found [here](https://github.com/Kivy-CN/Stanford-CS-229-CN/tree/master/CS229%E5%AE%98%E7%BD%91%E5%BD%93%E5%89%8D%E6%96%87%E6%A1%A3).

The code provided in the answers to the problem sets is implemented in Matlab, but I have implemented them all in Python and provided an ipynb format code summary of the algorithm process to help you understand the code logic. During this process, I referred to [ccombier](https://github.com/ccombier/stanford-CS229)'s code, which gave me good inspiration when I didn't know where to start.

I would especially like to thank [ccombier](https://github.com/ccombier/stanford-CS229) for also converting the code from many Matlab frameworks to Python, which makes it possible to implement all the code practice problems in Python.

At the same time, my [cs229 notes](https://yunlongs.cn/) may be helpful to you.
